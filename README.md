# MAtmos Condition Overrides for TFC & TFC+
These files contain the MAtmos condition overrides for use with TFC/TFC+.

This is the drag and drop version of the MAtmos condition overrides necessary for TFC and TFC+.
The conditions overriden allow for high altitude wind and ambience to play correctly through MAtmos while TFC/TFC+ is installed.
The reason users must override these conditions is because the soundpacks are designed with vanilla in mind, and thus, do not recognize the changes to altitude and sea level in TFC/TFC+. Without these changes, high altitude ambience will ALWAYS play. This is not only immersion breaking, but also, obnoxious.

The overrides included are for two soundpacks:
   - [MAtmos Default 2016](https://github.com/makamys/MAtmos-2016-Default)
   - [MAtmos "Zen"  2020](https://github.com/makamys/MAtmos-2020-Zen)


If you are using any other soundpacks or would like to make these changes yourself:

To install:

Extract or open the contents of the compressed (.zip) folder.
Drag the config folder into your .minecraft folder.

NOTE: IF YOU DISABLE THE OVERRIDEN EXPANSIONS BY SETTING VOLUME TO 0, YOU WILL DISABLE THE OVERRIDES AND WILL HAVE TO REDO THIS PROCESS.



To install optional soundpack:

If you plan on using both the Default 2016 and Zen 2020 packs, there is an included (optional) version
of the Default 2016 soundpack with overlapping wind sounds disabled for an improved sound experience. 

Simply disable/delete default 2016 (if you have it installed), and install the pack included with these files into your resourcepacks folder.
